            <h2>[Intro]</h2>
            <p>
                Man, what? (Haha)<br>
                This shit funny, one sec<br>
                Oof, this Hennessy strong as fuck, boy<br><br>
                She told me put my heart in the bag (In the bag)<br>
                And nobody gets hurt (No hurt)<br>
                Now I'm running from her love, I'm not fast (Fast)<br>
                So I'm making it worse (I'm making it worse)<br>
                Now I'm digging up a grave from my past<br>
                I'm a whole different person (I'm a whole different person)<br>
                It's a gift and a curse (It's a gift and a curse)<br>
                But I cannot reverse it<br>
            </p>
            <h3>[Verse 1]</h3>
            <p>
                I can't reverse it<br>
                It was a gift and a curse<br>
                And now I'm drinkin' too much, so I'ma talk with a slur<br>
                Last time I saw you, it ended in a blur<br>
                I woke up in a hearse<br>
                You said, "You loved me first" (First)<br>
                One thing my dad told me was, "Never let your woman know when you're insecure"<br>
                So I put Gucci on the fur<br>
                And I put my wrist on iceberg<br>
                One thing my heart tells me is<br>
                "Flex on a ho every time they're insecure"<br>
                I can't see it through, I'm running from you<br>
                Is your love for real? (For real? For real?)<br>
                Is your love really true?<br>
            </p>
        
            <h3>[Chorus]</h3>
            <p>
                She told me put my heart in the bag (In the bag)<br>
                And nobody gets hurt (Hurt)<br>
                Now I'm running from her love, I'm not fast (Fast)<br>
                So I'm making it worse (Worse)<br>
                Now I'm digging up a grave from my past (Past)<br>
                I'm a whole different person (Person)<br>
                It's a gift and a curse (Curse)<br>
                But I cannot reverse it<br>
            </p>
            <h3>[Bridge]</h3>
            <p>
                You gave me the runaround<br>
                I really hate the runaround<br>
                You really got me paranoid<br>
                I always keep a gun around<br>
                You always give me butterflies<br>
                When you come around<br>
                When you come around<br>
                When you come around<br>
            </p>
            <h3>[Verse 2]</h3>
            <p>
                You let me know love is not the answer<br>
                Not the answer, not the answer<br>
                I love to do drugs, so mind my manners<br>
                I get high when you don't decide to answer<br>
                Phone home, I need to phone home<br>
                I'm throwing rocks at your window, I need to go home<br>
                I don't wanna leave<br>
                I just wanna be with you<br>
                You, you, you<br>
            </p>
